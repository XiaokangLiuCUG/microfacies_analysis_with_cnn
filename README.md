microfacies_analysis_with_dcnn

We used four classic DCNN (VGG-16, Inception v4, ResNet-152, and Inception ResNet v2) architectures for fossil and abiotic grains identification during the microfacies and. it's achieved up to 95% of top one and 99% of top three accuracies. 

Click the master branch to find the frozen models of the Inception v4 and Inception ResNet v2.
